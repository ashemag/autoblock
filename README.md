# Twitter Autoblocker

For automatically blocking hateful content on twitter.

### Set Up

Requirements: python=3.6, must have chrome installed, tested on mac os.
<br/>

1. Clone/download repo <br/>
2. Open terminal and cd into repo folder. <br/>
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br/>
4. Enter in your twitter username and password or save those as environment variables and press ENTER for both prompts. <br/>
5. Enter in the url of a hateful tweet to autoblock the author and those that liked it. <br/>
6. Double check your list of blocked users. <br/>

Note: When you first run the program Twitter may flag this as a login from a new device. The program saves your cookies so that the next time you run it you a) won't be prompted for your twitter credentials and b) should not get the Twitter notification about a new device.
